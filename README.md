Shanghai
==========

Source of the Color Computer 3 game Shanghai.

### Overview

This _development_ branch is used to build an updated version of the game with
an improved victory screen, to include more of the intended dragon graphic
since it is run from disk and can use more memory than the cartridge version.

See the _master_ branch for a more historical look at the original game.
